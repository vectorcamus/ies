| Publication         | I have used Digital garden plugin to publish my personal Obsidian Vault through Vercel. This Static website is written in markdown and with minimal use of Html syntax. I will try to incorporate interactive feature in Upcoming days post Examination. Obviously there is room for improvement but for me this is the minimum effort website without java script, css or php. Within a year i will try to make it an full fledged  interactive website.                                                                                                                                                   |

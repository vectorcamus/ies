### Why Did Harappa Civilisation degenerate and finally collapse ? 

Most of the sites declined by 1800 BCE ; some gradual(Mohenodaro and Dholavira)  and some sudden (Banwalli , Kalibangan). There are ==several inconclusive theories== regarding for such decline. 

1. Mohenojodaro was repeatedly flooded either by tectonic movements , destruction of dams or due to change in course of river indus. Ghaggar-Hakra valley shows some evidence of  flood of Sutlej and Yamuna  which resulted in drastic reduction in near river sites. 
2. Sudden rise of Arabian sea coastline may have resulted in flood and rise in soil salinity which disrupted trade . Decline of lapis lazuli trade with Mesopotamia also could be one of the reason . 
3. Onset of drier climate could have resulted into decline in agriculture and mass migration. 
4. Environmental changes like over exploitation of resources , over cultivation and over grazing combined with over population made harappan cultural region unsustainable for urbanised culture . 
5. Archeological evidence does not give any social and political dimension of decline but gradual process of de urbanisation , diversification into more agro-rural mean of economic and social organisation in post urban phase  made harappan cultural homogeneity obscure throughout the South Asia where it prospered once. 
6. The popular but inconclusive hypothesis of Indo-Aryan Influx (If gradual ) or Invasion (Sudden) may have caused final blow to the Civilisation.

| 25  | A). The ordinary least square estimate of \beta  in the classical linear regression model  : $Y_i=\alpha +\beta X_i =U_i ; i=1,2,\dots, n$ is $\hat \beta =\sum_{i=1}^n W_i Y_i$ , where $W_i= \frac{x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}$ and$x_i=X_i-\bar X , \bar X = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$. Show that if $Var (\hat \beta) = \frac{\hat \sigma_u^2}{\sigma){i=1}^n x_i^2}$ , no other linear unbiased estimator of $\beta$ can be constructed with smaller variance. (All symbols have their usual meaning) . B).Consider the regression model:  $Yi =\alpha +\beta X_i +U_i$  where$Y$ is the quantity demanded of bread and $X$ is the price of the butter, and $U_i$ isa random term that is distributed normally with mean zero and unknown variance $\sigma_u^2$ . A sample of 20 observations yields the following information: $\sum_{i=1}^20 Y_i =21.9 \sum_{i=1}^20 (Y_i-Y)^2 =86.9 ,  sum_{i=1}^20 X_i =186.2 \sum_{i=1}^20 (X_i-X)^2 =215.4 , sum_{i=1}^20  (X_i-X) (Y_i-Y) =106.4$ .

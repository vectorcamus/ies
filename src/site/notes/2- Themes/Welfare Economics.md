| A) "It is not possible to construct social preferences from individual preferences without violating one or more of the five axioms." Examine the statement given by Arrow. B) Consider the economy with two goods and fixed factor supplies. Assume that the social welfare function defined in commodity space: $w=(x_1 +2)x_2$ and that society’s implicit production function $x_1 +2x_2 –1=0$ . Find the values of $x_1$ and $x_2$ that maximise social welfare. C) Explain ‘Compensation Principle' and ‘Test Criteria’ formulated by Hicks-Scitovsky.                                                                                                                                                                           | <span style="background:#fff88f">Compensation principle</span>                                                            |           | 2022 | 12+6+7  | 300   |

| In a competitive market, the demand function is given as $Q_D = 24 - P$, while the marginal cost of production is $MC = 2 + Q$. There is a negative externality giving rise to the total externalities cost $𝐶 = −2𝑄 + \frac{𝑄^2}{2}$ .

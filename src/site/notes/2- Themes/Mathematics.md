| A local business firm is planning to advertise a special sale on radio and television. Its weekly advertising budget is 16,000. A radio commercial costs 800 per 30-second slot while a television commercial costs 4,000 per 30-second slot. Radio slots cannot be bought less than 6 in number while TV slots available are at the most 4 per week. Given that a TV slot is 6 times as effective as a radio slot in reaching consumers, how should the firm allocate its advertising budget to attract the largest number of them? How will the optimal solution be affected if the availability of the television slots is no longer constrained?  I. Formulate LPP model II.

| Consider the optimisation problem:  Maximise $u(x_1,x_2)$ Subject to $M = p_1x_1 + p_2x_2$ Where, M, $p_1$ and $p_2$ are positive constants. Write down the Lagrangian for this problem and explain why you need to assume that an interior solution exists before using Lagrangian method to solve the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | <span style="background:#d2cbff">Optimisation techniques</span>                                            | 2018 | 5      | 100   |

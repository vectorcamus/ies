| 6   | A local business firm is planning to advertise a special sale on radio and television. Its weekly advertising budget is 16,000. A radio commercial costs 800 per 30-second slot while a television commercial costs 4,000 per 30-second slot. Radio slots cannot be bought less than 6 in number while TV slots available are at the most 4 per week. Given that a TV slot is 6 times as effective as a radio slot in reaching consumers, how should the firm allocate its advertising budget to attract the largest number of them? How will the optimal solution be affected if the availability of the television slots is no longer constrained?  I. Formulate LPP model II. Solve the above using graphical method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Matrices and their application in economics                        | 2021 | 10+15  | 300   |
| 7   | **a.** An economy produces only coal and steel. The two commodities serve as intermediate inputs in each other’s production. 0.4 tonne of steel and 0.7 tonne of coal are needed to produce a tonne of steel. Similarly, 0.1 tonne of steel and 0.6 tonne of coal are required to produce a tonne of coal. No capital inputs are needed. 2 and 5 labour days are required to produce a tonne of coal and steel respectively. If the economy needs 100 tonnes of coal and 50 tonnes of steel, **I.** Calculate the gross output of the two commodities and the total labor required. **II.** Write down technology matrix. **iii.** Do you think that the system is viable? **IV.** Determine the equilibrium prices if the wage rate is rs. 10 per man day. **B)**. Mohan is paid rs. 8 if two coins turn both heads and rs. 1 if two coins turn both tails. Ram is paid rs. 3 when two coins don’t match. **I.** write down the pay-off matrix of the above problem. **II.** whom do you consider in a better situation? | Matrices and their application in economics                        | 2020 | 15+10  | 300   |

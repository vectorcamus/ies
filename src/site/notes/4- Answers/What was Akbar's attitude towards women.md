> Akbar also introduced a number of social and educational reforms. <span style="background:#d3f8b6">He stopped sati, the burning of a widow, unless she herself, of her own free will, persistently desired it. Widows of tender age who had not shared the bed with their husbands were not to be burnt at all. Widow remarriage was also legalised. Akbar was against anyone having more than one wife unless the first wife was barren. The age of marriage was raised to 14 for girls and 16 for boys.</span> The sale of wines and spirits was restricted. Not all these steps were, however, successful. As we know, the success of social legislation depends largely on the willing cooperation of the people. Akbar was living in an age of superstition and it seems that his social reforms had only limited success.

> Akbar's attitude towards women was progressive for his time. He opposed social evils like child marriage and sati, taking measures to discourage them. Akbar raised the minimum marriage age for boys and girls and strictly enforced laws against sati unless the widow consented freely. He encouraged widow remarriage and prohibited the practice of selling women. Akbar respected womenâ€™s roles in governance, often consulting women from his court. He also sought to improve the status of royal women by ensuring their education and involvement in cultural and religious discussions, promoting greater respect and dignity for women in Mughal society.

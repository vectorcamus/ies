- The loss of water supply as Yamuna and Sutlej moved away from the Sarasvati-Hakra. 
- Rainfall decreased at about that time. 
- Dam formation in the Indus leading to a massive flooding of Mohenjodaro either due to tectonic or human fault. 
- The emergence of Elam as a powerful state  interrupted Harappan Export & Import to Mesopotamia. Trad like Tin collapsed.

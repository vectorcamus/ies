> 1. Money is unit of Measurement for cardinal utility measurement. Any cardinal unit of account should be scale independent. 
> 2. When price changes (Increase /Fall) the real income of a consumer changes (Falls /Increase).
> 3. The change in real income changes the marginal utility of money . That means for utility is different for same amount of commodity  at different price point.
> 4. This leads to very inconsistent and unreliable measurement which can turn cardinal measure into a subjective ordinal measure. 
> 5. Also , according to Marshall an individuals expenditure is very small part of whole expenditure therefore marginal utility of money will not vary significantly and it is better to assume a constant utility to measure change in utility objectively .

> The constancy assumption of marginal utility of money is crucial in cardinal utility analysis to simplify and quantify consumer behavior. It assumes that the utility derived from each additional unit of money remains constant, regardless of income changes. This enables economists to measure and compare utilities across goods and individuals in monetary terms, making utility quantifiable. Without this assumption, varying marginal utility of money would complicate analysis, as changes in income or expenditure could distort utility comparisons. Thus, the assumption provides a stable framework for evaluating consumer choices and deriving demand curves in cardinal utility analysis.

 - To overcome adverse selection between principal and agent ;  it is necessary to 

	1. Reduce higher risk agents to reduce negative externality created by them. 
	2. Increase Lower risk agents who can significantly drive up "expected pay off" of principal to gain non negative profit.

	1. Agent should not be allowed to buy arbitrary multiple contract apart from one which is offered for sale. 
	2. An equilibrium contract for low risk type must not be attractive to High risk types.

	1. **Screening** : To drive out Higher risk agents screening is used by  the <span style="background:#fff88f">uninformed side</span> taking actions to reduce the information asymmetry. For example, insurance provider can  use price discrimination strategies to identify customers with high vs low willingness to pay and charge them accordingly. They can charge different premium rates based on genetic profile , past physical health , early sign of diseases etc. 
	2. **Signalling** : To attract Lower risk agents an  incentive mechanism can be created to distinguish between low and high risk agents. Here signalling can be  used by the <span style="background:#fff88f">informed side</span> to take actions to reduce the information asymmetry. For example, high skill workers getting certifications to signal their productivity to  earn a higher wage (Pareto improvement).  Any one who chooses not to take test will be correctly  considered as not better than worst worker.

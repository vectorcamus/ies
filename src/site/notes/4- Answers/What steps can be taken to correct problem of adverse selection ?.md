<span style="background:#fff88f">To overcome adverse selection between principal and agent ;  it is necessary to</span> 

1. Reduce higher risk agents to eliminate negative externality created by them. 
2. Increase quantity of lower risk agents significantly to drive up "expected pay off" of principal to non negative values. 

<span style="background:#fff88f">This can be done by creating **at least two** separate equilibriums in form of menu of contracts. </span>

**Step 1** : <span style="background:#b1ffff">Design contracts with restrictive rules</span> . 

1. Agent should not be allowed to choose arbitrary multiple contract apart from one which is offered by principal for sale (**At most one contract**) 
2. An equilibrium contract for low risk type agents  must not be attractive to High risk types agents . 

 **Step 2** : <span style="background:#b1ffff">Reduce information asymmetry by</span> 

1. <span style="background:#fdbfff">Screening</span> : Here **uninformed side** takes  actions. For example, insurance provider can  use price discrimination strategies to identify customers with high vs low willingness to pay and charge them accordingly. They can charge different premium rates based on genetic profile , past physical health , early sign of diseases ,individual ratings etc.

Low-risk individuals can buy insurance at a rate reflected by AE; high-risk individuals must pay the rate reflected by AF. If insurers cannot distinguish among individuals, high-risk people will choose AE -type policies and cause them to be 1 unprofitable. Low-risk individuals will be made worse off by the absence of such policies. |



2. <span style="background:#fdbfff">Signalling</span> : To attract Lower risk agents an  incentive mechanism can be created to distinguish between low and high risk agents. Here signalling can be  used by the **informed side** to take actions to reduce the information asymmetry. For example, high skill workers getting certifications to signal their productivity so they can  earn a higher wage ( Pareto improvement ).  Any one who chooses not to take test will be correctly  considered as not better than worst worker.

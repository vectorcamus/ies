> Major Sufi orders in India include *Chishti, Suhrawardi, Qadiri, and Naqshbandi*. The *Chishti order*, led by saints like Moinuddin Chishti, emphasized love, tolerance, and serving humanity. The *Suhrawardi order*, founded by Shihabuddin Suhrawardi, was more orthodox, focusing on sharia and scholarship. The *Qadiri order* highlighted spiritual purification and devotion, while the *Naqshbandi order* stressed adherence to Islamic law and silent meditation.

| 50    | Cardinal utility approach and Ordinal utility approach to demand suggest same decision rule for the optimising consumer (which one?). Yet, latter approach is preferred over former.

| 5     | a) Show that the substitution effect is always negative by using the weak axiom of revealed preference theory. b) A farmer grows 70kg of $X_1$ and 20 kg of $X_2$.He keeps some parts of $X_1$ and $X_2$  for self consumption and sells the rest in the market . His Utility Function is $U(X_1, X_2) = Min (2X_1, X_2)$ and price of $X_1$ and $X_2$  are 2 and 3 respectively .Suppose the price of $X_1$ increases to 4 and at the same time his consumption of $X_1$ also increases.

The demand function for the electricity, of the people is $q = \alpha p^{−\beta}$. If the elasticity of demand for electricity in absolute sense is found to be $0.894$ .

The two commodities serve as intermediate inputs in each other’s production. 0.4 tonne of steel and 0.7 tonne of coal are needed to produce a tonne of steel. Similarly, 0.1 tonne of steel and 0.6 tonne of coal are required to produce a tonne of coal. No capital inputs are needed. 2 and 5 labour days are required to produce a tonne of coal and steel respectively.

| 6   | A local business firm is planning to advertise a special sale on radio and television. Its weekly advertising budget is 16,000. A radio commercial costs 800 per 30-second slot while a television commercial costs 4,000 per 30-second slot. Radio slots cannot be bought less than 6 in number while TV slots available are at the most 4 per week. Given that a TV slot is 6 times as effective as a radio slot in reaching consumers, how should the firm allocate its advertising budget to attract the largest number of them? How will the optimal solution be affected if the availability of the television slots is no longer constrained?  I. Formulate LPP model II.

Assume three explanatory variables like $X_1, X_2$and $X_3$ ,  which are found to be highly collinear. The following three principal components (PC) and their corresponding eigenvalues ($λ$) are reported as:$PC_1 = a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3  , PC_2 = a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 , PC_3 = a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3$ ; where $a_{ij}$ be the factor loading of the $i$ th principal component of the $j$ th factor, and $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$ and $\lambda_3$ are the eigenvalues of first, second and third principal components respectively.

State that if Xi takes the values $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Var(\hat \beta 2) > Var(b_2)$ ,  where $\hat \beta_2$ is the OLS estimator of $\beta_2$ and $b_2$  is the GLS estimator of $\beta_2$.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Problems and remedies of Heteroscedasticity, Autocorrelation & Multicollinearity |           | 2017 | 5+12+8   | 300   |

| 26  | 1. Define autocorrelation and state what are the possible sources of autocorrelation.  2. Suppose that the time series data follows the auto-regressive scheme of order one, that is, AR(1). Show that an AR(1) process is simply an MA(∞) process (that is,moving average scheme of order infinity).  3. Find the mean and variance if the time series data are modelled by the process $Y_t =a+Y_{t−1}+\epsilon_t$ where $ε_t$ is a pure white noise.  Find out also, the auto-correlation coefficient of sth order. Interpret your results.

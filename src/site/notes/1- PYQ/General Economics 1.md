Find the optimal provision of the public good if the marginal cost of producing it is i. 240 and ii. 50. In each case, draw diagrams to explain your answer. c. What is the Coase theorem? A factory pollutes a river where fishermen operate. A pollution treatment plant costs Rs. 2 lakhs to install while the damage to fishermen is Rs. 1 lakh if the pollution treatment plant is not installed.

| <p align="justify">Agriculture is the most important production practice of the world. Despite the fact that during last five decades world food production has increased almost threefold, population has increased at such a rate in less developed countries that it overtipped the food production. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that about 840 million people remain chronically hungry, nearly 800 million of them living in developing countries. Every year hunger kills 12 million children worldwide. Although the number of people suffering from hunger has been decreasing, 2•5 million per year over the last decade, but the World Food Summit's 1996 target of cutting half the number of world's chronically hungry and undernourished people by 2015, will be met 100 years late if the present trend of increase in population coupled with poverty continues. There is enough food in the world to provide at least 2 kg per person, including 1 kg of grains or its substitute per day and other eatables to make people fit, but the problem is that many people are too poor to buy readily available food. The global problem of food insufficiency is causing undernourishment and malnutrition. Undernourishment refers to the lack of sufficient calories in available diet, so that one has little or no ability to move or work. The reason being, the body begins to break down its own stored fats and proteins. Undernourishment is more common in poor countries. People receiving less than 90 percent of their minimum dietary intake, on a long-term basis, are considered as undernourished. While not starving to death, such people do not have enough energy for an active and productive life. These people are more susceptible to diseases and deficiency diseases like beriberi and anaemia due to lack of nutrients. Such people are weak and cannot work because of poor diet. On account of inadequate income they cannot afford good food. Since they cannot work, they cannot buy food for their dependent children. Thus, their children fail to grow properly and are likely to face impoverishment in their adulthood. Those receiving less than 75 percent of their minimum daily caloric intake requirements are considered seriously undernourished. The undernourished children are likely to suffer from permanently stunted growth, mental retardation and other development disorders. Malnourishment refers to lack of specific components of food, such as proteins, vitamins or certain essential elements, required for the sound health and development of human body. Malnourishment can be caused both by over- nourishment to have excess food without a proper nutritional balance caused by lack of a specific dietary constituents or an inability to absorb or utilize essential nutrients from the food. Poor diet may result in faulty nutrition causing lack of appetite and abnormal absorption of nutrients by the gastrointestinal tract. Poor nutrition and ill-health, in the long run, result in overall drop in quality of life and in the levels of development of human potential. Since people get afflicted by nutritional or related disorders, there is lowering of working capacity and productivity potential resulting in economic losses. The children become weak or sick and their educational career is affected. Malnourished and underweight children, surviving their childhood, face their future as adults with compromised abilities and ill-health. Malnutrition and its ill effects can be avoided by consuming balanced and varied diet that includes all essential groups of foods. In general, the balanced diet includes plenty of whole grains, pulses, vegetables, fat, sugar, milk, fruit, etc., for vegetarians and meat and egg in addition or as a replacement, for non-vegetarians. Cereals like wheat and rice, the staple food of mankind, provide a fraction of nutrient supply and need to be supplemented with other foods that provide proteins, fats and traces of minerals, vitamins and amino acids. A balanced diet simply means a diet that will supply all the nutrients necessary for the growth and development of the body. The healthiest combination for a balanced diet, in general, is that about 50 percent of calories should come from complex carbohydrates, about 30 percent from all fats and about 20 percent from proteins. Conclusively, a balanced diet in a suitable proportion and variation in menu in our daily meals will prove better for the health. ==(710 words)==</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 2024 |
| <p align="justify">The Earth is a home for a rich and diverse array of living organisms, whose genetic diversity and relationship with each other, constitute the planet's biodiversity. It includes species as well as varieties found within the same species, as also the enormous ecosystems and habitats forests, grasslands, oceans and its depths, peats and peat bogs. Worldwide, an area of tropical forest equal to a football field, is disappearing every second. Forests are being cleared for agriculture, cattle ranching and for timber. They get submerged when dams are constructed. When forests are felled we deal a blow to biodiversity, the richness of life. Five great waves of extinction have decimated our planet's species in the remote past. The sixth wave, which we are witnessing, is largely man made. One-fourth of the Earth's total biological diversity, amounting to about 1.6 million species, which might be useful to mankind in one way or the other, is in the serious risk of existence and if we ignore the biodiversity crisis, we would lose these species in the next 25 years. If we respond with knowledge and technology, we might hold the loss to 10 percent, but even this amounts to millions of species. It is a well-known fact the ecosystem is undergoing changes due to pollution, invasive species, over-exploitation by humans, climate change and many other reasons. Most of the people are beginning to recognize that biodiversity is not only for availing the benefits, but is also to be conserved in all its forn]s. The importance of species diversity conservation is usually justified by the direct use of the species by man, as food sources, fibre, fuel, new chemicals and raw materials. When a species is lost, it is lost for ever. Our ethics tell us that we should not deprive our future generations from the economic and aesthetic benefits that can be derived from biodiversity. It is our moral duty to look after our planet and pass it on to our future generations in good health. The decisions taken by us now, as an individual and as a society will deterniine the diversity of genes, species or ecosystems that remain in future. Top priority should be given to check destruction or degradation of habitats, because it is most responsible for the loss of biodiversity. More knowledge is required to conserve biodiversity in view of reduced space under increased pressure of human activities. Unless immediate actions are taken to 11 protect the biodiversity, we will lose forever the opportunity of reaping its full potential benefit in the present and in future. Conservation of biodiversity is concerned with the protection of genes and species and their number in population, ecosystems or habitats. It is important to conserve numerous varieties of plants and animals. Each variety within a species contains unique genes. The diversity of genes within a species increases its adaptability to pollution, diseases, stresses and other environmental changes. When varieties of plants and animals are destroyed the genetic diversity within the species is diminished. Biodiversity conservation refers to the efforts to maintain or enhance biodiversity involving protection, upliftment and scientific management at its optimum level in order to derive sustainable benefits for the present as well as for the future Biodiversity conservation study is aimed at knowing how human activities affect the diversity of plants and animals and developing ways to protect it. Thus conservation of biodiversity, the Earth's biological heritage, is one of today's most pressing environmental issues. The challenge lies before individuals, organisations and government agencies for nations and the world as a whole to protect and enhance biological diversity, while continuing to meet people's need for natural resources. If these goals are not met, the future generations will live in a biologically impoverished world. There are two approaches of biodiversity conservation namely in situ (on site) conservation, which tries to protect the species where they are, i.e., in their natural habitats and ex situ (off site) conservation, which attempts to protect and preserve a species in a place away from its natural habitat.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 2023 |
| <p align="justify">Joy and sadness are experienced by people in all cultures around the worl(L but how can we tell when other people are happy or despondent? It turns out that the expression of many emotions may be universal. Smiling is apparently a universal sign of friendliness and approval. Baring the teeth in a hostile way, as noted by Charles Darwin in the nineteenth century, may be a universal sign of anger. As the originator of the theory of evolution, Darwin believed that the universal recognition of facial expressions would have survival value. For example, facial expressions could signal the approach of enemies (or friends) in the absence of language. Most investigators concur that certain facial expressions suggest the same emotions in all people. Moreover, people in diverse cultures recognize the emotions manifested by the facial expressions. In classic research Paul Ekman took photographs of people exhibiting the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness and sadness. He then asked people around the world to indicate what emotions were being depicted in them. Those queried ranged from European college students to members of the Fore, a tribe that dwells in the New Guinea highlands. All groups, including the Fore, who had almost no contact with Western culture, agreed on the portrayed emotions. The Fore also displayed familiar facial expressions when asked how they would respond if they were the characters in stories that called for basic emotional responses. Ekn]an and his colleagues more recently obtained similar results in a study of ten cultures in which participants were pernlitted to report that multiple emotions were shown by facial expressions. The participants generally agreed on which two emotions were being shown and which emotion was more intense. Psychological researchers generally recognize that facial expressions reflect emotional states. In fact, various emotional states give rise to certain patterns of electrical activity in the facial muscles and in the brain. The facial-feedback hypothesis argues, however, that the causal relationship between emotions and facial expressions can also work in the opposite direction. According to this hypothesis, signals from the facial muscles are sent back to emotion centres of the brain, and so a person's facial expression can influence that person's emotional state. Consider Darwin's words . "The free expression by outward signs of an emotion intensifies it. On the other hand, the repression, as far as possible, of all outward signs softens our emotions." Can smiling give rise to feelings of goodwill, for example, and frowning to anger ? Psychological research has given rise to some interesting findings concerning the facial-feedback hypothesis, causing participants in experiments to smile for example, leads them to report more positive feelings and to rate cartoons as being more humorous. When they are caused to frown, they rate cartoons as being more aggressive. What are the possible links between facial expressions and emotion ? One link is arousal, which is the level of activity or preparedness for activity in an organism. Intense contraction of facial muscles, such as those used in signifying fear, heightens arousal. Self-perception of heightened arousal then leads to heightened emotional activity. Other links may involve changes in brain temperature and the release of neurotransmitters (substances that transmit nerve impulses). The contraction of facial muscles both influences the internal emotional state and reflects it. Ekman has found that the so-called Duchenne smile, which is characterized by "crow's-feet" wrinkles around the eyes and a subtle drop in the eye cover fold so that the skin above the eye moves down slightly toward the eyeball, can lead to pleasant feelings. Ekman's observation may be relevant to the British expression "Keep a stiff upper lip" as a recommendation for handling stress. It might be that a "stiff ' lip suppresses emotional response - as long as the lip is not quivering with fear or tension. But when the emotion that leads to stiffening the lip is more intense, and involves strong muscle tension, facial feedback may heighten emotional response.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 2022 |
| <p align="justify">Let us begin with the question what is science ? Karl Popper, an influential 20th_century philosopher of science, thought that the fundamental feature of a scientific theory is that it should be falsifiable. To call a theory falsifiable is not to say that it is false. Rather, it means that the theory makes some definite predictions that are capable of being tested against experience. If these predictions turn out to be wrong, then the theory has been falsified, or disproved. So a falsifiable theory is one that we might discover to be false - it is not compatible with every possible course of experience. Popper thought that some supposedly scientific theories did not satisfy this condition and thus did not deserve to be called science at all; rather they were merely pseudo-science. Freud's psychoanalytic theory was one of Popper's favourite examples of pseudo-science. According to Popper, Freud's theory could be reconciled with any empirical findings whatsoever. Whatever a patient's behaviour, Freudians could find an explanation of it in terms of their theory they would never admit that their theory was wrong. Popper illustrated his point with the following example. Imagine a man who pushes a child into a river with the intention of murdering him, and another man who sacrifices his life in order to save the child. Freudians can explain both men's behaviour with equal ease: the first was repressed, and the second had achieved sublimation. Popper argued that through the use of such concepts as repression, sublimation, and unconscious desires, Freud's theory could be rendered compatible with any clinical data whatever; it was thus unfalsifiable. The same was true of Marx's theory of history, Popper maintained. Marx claimed that in industrialized societies around the world, capitalism would give way to socialism and ultimately to communism. But when this didn't happen, instead of admitting that Marx's theory was wrong, Marxists would invent an ad hoc explanation for why what happened was actually perfectly consistent with their theory. For example, they might say that the inevitable progress to communism had been temporarily slowed by the rise of the welfare state, which 'softened' the proletariat and weakened their revolutionary zeal. In this sort of way, Marx's theory could be made compatible with any possible course of events, just like Freud's. Therefore, neither theory qualifies as genuinely scientific, according to Popper's criterion. Popper contrasted Freud's and Marx's theories with Einstein's theory of gravitation, also known as general relativity. Unlike Freud's and Marx's theories, Einstein's theory made a very definite prediction: that light rays from distant stars would be deflected by the gravitational field of the sun. Nornially this effect would be impossible to observe - except during a solar eclipse. In 1919, the English astrophysicist, Sir Arthur Eddington organized two expeditions to observe the solar eclipse of that year, one to Brazil and one to the island of Principe off the Atlantic coast of Africa, with the aim of testing Einstein's prediction. The expeditions found that starlight was indeed deflected by the sun, by almost exactly the amount Einstein had predicted. Popper was very impressed by this. Einstein's theory had made a definite, precise prediction which was confirmed by observations. Had it turned out that starlight as not deflected by the sun, this would have showed that Einstein was wrong. So Einstein's theory satisfies the criterion of falsifiability. Poppers attempt to demarcate science from pseudo-science is intuitively quite plausible. There is certainly something fishy about a theory that can be made to fit any empirical data whatsoever. But some philosophers regard Popper's criterion as overly simplistic. Popper criticized Freudians and Marxists for explaining away any data that appeared to conflict with their theories, rather than accepting that the theories had been refuted. This certainly looks like a suspicious procedure. However, there is some evidence that this very procedure is routinely used by 'respectable' scientists whom Popper would not want to accuse of engaging in pseudo-science - and has led to important scientific discoveries. ==(659 words)==</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 2021 |
| <p align="justify">What part should reading play in our lives ? It should certainly not be a substitute for action, not for independent thinking, nor for conversation; but it may be a help and stimulant to action, thought and talk; and it is capable of providing almost infinite pleasure. There on our bookshelves or on summons from a library are wit, wisdom, adventure, romance from all ages and all over the world. Is there any wonder that our eyes sometimes stray wistfully to the bookshelves and away from a dull visitor, or that we shirk a tiresome duty for an exciting book ? Books or people ? Reading or Conversation or, nowadays, listening in to the radio ? Which is the better way to gain knowledge or to spend your leisure ? Some fortunate people seem always to find time for both and to enjoy both almost equally. My great friend, Arthur Wauchope, a fine soldier, a most able administrator and a very gifted personality, was a constant reader, yet was always ready to lay aside a book for talk and was a most interesting and interested talker. The advantages of reading over talk are of course that we ean select the book that suits our mood, can go at our own pace, skip, or turn back, whereas we cannot turn over two pages of a tedious companion or close him, or her, with a bang. But reading lacks the human touch, the salt of life, and is, therefore, a dangerous substitute for thought or action. Bacon in one of his essays says that reading maketh a full man; conference (that is talking) a ready man; and writing an exact man. One would like to be full of knowledge, ready in speech, and exact by training. But full of what ? What sort of reading has impressed itself on my memory, and what books have found a pernianent place on my bookshelves ? To begin with my profession, soldiering. I do not believe that soldiering, a practical business, in which human nature is the main element, can be learnt from text-books, and more than can boxing or cricket or golf. But for those who have grasped the principles of war and have understood that the human factor is the most important element in it, there is military reading that is fascinating and valuable. 'Read and re-read the campaigns of the great commanders,, said Napoleon. I would venture to put it differently and would say that the lives and characters of the great commanders are what students of war should examine, since their campaigns are only incidents in them; and that the behaviour of leaders and of their men in the field is the subject for study. Take Napoleon's first campaign of 1796. The text-book will tell you that he won by manoeuvre on interior lines or by the principle of concentration of force or some similar conjuration. One learns nothing, I hold, by such dogma. In my general reading, history, biography and travel occupy, I think, first place; and since I have spent a considerable proportion of my lrfe in the East there are a good number of volumes on India and the Middle East. There is plenty of poetry on my shelves and a good deal of it in my head. I have put my notions of poetry in a book already and will not repeat them here, except to express my firni belief that poetry in some shape or another is one of the most precious of our heritages, and that much of what.tnes to pass for poetry nowadays is not poetry at all, and not even decently camouflaged as such. Poetry should dance in the mind, and blow one a kiss; or gallop to adventure with a cheer; or whisper gently of sad things past; not shuffle or slouch past with dark incomprehensible mutterings. Perhaps I am getting old, anyway I prefer the old poets. Lastly comes what is sometimes called 'escapist' literature, the books we read with no other aim than to rest or to amuse the mind, to forget the daily chores and the tomorrow's anxieties. This is perhaps the most pleasant form of reading for most.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 2020 |
| <p align="justify">- Indians are known for jealously preserving their cultural identity. They continue to cling to their norn]s of endogamy, marital stability and family solidarity, kin orientation, religion and mother tongue. They are always nostalgic about Indian food and their women tend to stick to their lovely saru. As for the mechanisms of their cultural preservation, mention must be made of temples and gurdwaras, practice of keerlan and akhand path, audio cassettes of devotional songs, video cassettes of Ramayan and Mahabharat, festivals and functions, and ethnic associations and organisations. What is more, even picnics provide occasions to reinforce old cultural practices. For instance, I was truly astonished to see antakshari (a verbal game in which the last letter of the verse recited by one participant has to be used as the starting letter of the verse by another participant) played in Sanskrit hymns in a picnic of Indians in Salt Lake City in USA. Overseas Indians adhere to their traditional culture so ostensibly that at times it appears that they are more Indian in their cultural orientations and practices than resident Indians in India. Take, for instance, the Sikhs who are quick to tske to modern ways in India but they tend to be rather orthodox abroad. Even those Indians who couldn't care less for their culture in India become quite observant of it in foreign lands. Why do Indians get so faithful to their culture in foreign lands while at home they seem to favour Western culture ? Several explanations come to mind. One, that they fmd in their culture a defence mechanism against a sense of insecurity in alien settings. Two, that they might be banking on their culture as a compensatory mechanism for the loss of status in foreign lands. Three, maybe there is something in the Indian culture - perhaps its adhesive quality - that accounts for it. Four, maybe it is a sense of pride of belonging to one of the oldest cultures of the world that makes them so reverent to it. Fifth, it may well be so because the immigrants get stuck to their conception of Indian culture of the time when they had left India and remain blissfully unaware of the changes it has undergone since then. As important as it is, the question of cultural identity of overseas Indians needs careful scrutiny. It involves several issues. The frst is the issue of how Indians abroad perceive their self-identity. Do they view themselves as Indians or as Punjabis, Gujaratis, etc. ? In other words, do they identify themselves in tern]s of pan-Indian identity or in tern]s of a parochial ethnic category. According to Fisher (1980) Indians have difficulty in organising as Indians. More often than not they tend to identify themselves in tern]s of narrow ethnic categories. By and large Fisher is righL The only thing I may add is that perhaps it is the context that detern]ines their self-identity. It seems that while dealing with the non~Indians they tend to take on pan-Indian identity. But when it comes to interacting among themselves their regional, linguistic or religious identities tske precedence. A second issue is how others look upon Indians. Are they viewed as Indians or as Asians ? That depends on several things including their relative numerical strength in the host county. Wherever Indians forni a substantial group, they are viewed as Indians having a distinctive identity. In the countries where their number is small and the ethnic groups of other nationalities are also present they tend to be bracketed with the other Asians. Even at the risk of sounding outrageous, it may be remarked that perhaps too much is made in the existing literature of the instinct of cultural preservation and identity of Indians in foreign settings. For one thing, perhaps every ethnic group ten(Ls to stick to its culture in strange surroundings about as fastidiously as do the Indians. Are Chinese immigrants any different from Indians ? It requires a comparative study of various immigrant communities, including Indians, to maintain that the Indians stand out among others. For another, there is no dearth of contradictory "evidence to show that any number of Indians have abandoned their culture in favour of the cultures of their adopted lands. Third, there is a generational context to it. While the first generation immigrants tend to stick to Indian culture with vigour, the second and subsequent generations give evidence of distancing from it. ==(731 words)==</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 2019 |
| <p align="justify">Education has not been of the kind that can help you towards happiness. It has not been of the kind that can make you capable of freedom. The aim of education in a democracy must be the same for all the people. Education must aim at making them all capable of freedom, for they are all to be free. Whatever education will achieve, this aim must be given to every person in proportion to his capacity to receive it. If education is necessary for one, it must be necessary for all. Only in this way can we hope to prevent the exploitation of one group by another. Only in this way can we develop a true community. The citizens must be able to understand one another. They must have a common culture. They must have the intellectual training needed to comprehend it and to communicate with those who share it. Education for freedom consists in transmitting to the rising generation the civilization they have inherited, together with the techniques by which it may be understood. No man or woman is equipped to be a ruler without this education. As liberal education helps us to establish a free community, so does it to preserve it. As Thomas F. Woodlock has said in the Wall Street Journal, "Democracy rests ultimately upon 'public opinion, as its base. Public opinion follows upon free speech, free interchange of ideas, of judgements, of opinions; it is generated by these things. Men interchange these things by words... . Sound logic it was that put grammar, logic, and rhetoric as preliminary to geometry, arithmetic, music, and astronomy in the scheme of the seven liberal arts in an age which was notable for the clearness of its thinking and the exactitude of its expression. Both these things are absolutely necessary for the functioning of democracy as the best fonn of government. If we are going to 'educate for democracy,, we had better find the right way to teach them." And the ability to read and write is the best defence against anti-democratic propaganda. Under the name of 'indoctrination of democracy, a host of lies is being propagated. When a person equipped with the liberal arts has critically studied the basic theoretical questions, he is proof against the. seductions of the New Order. The reason why we may justly fear such propaganda today is that we are uneducated. In addition to all the above merits, liberal education has yet another . it is the best vocational training. Vocational training of the usual sort trains hands. The ideal education for freedom is a liberal education in the liberal arts and the cultural heritage of the county. Since it is the ideal, we must aim at it for every citizen. Unless the citizen can master the liberal arts and the fundamental principles of a free society he cannot function as a member of a free community. He cannot help to keep the community as a free community. If we cannot give liberal education to every citizen in proportion to his capacity to receive it we might as well give up our hopes achieving a democratic community. We cannot insist on free men and at the same time say that we cannot educate our population for freedom. We cannot insist on a community and at the same time say that it is impossible to strengthen the basis of communication among our people. Individual happiness, good citizenship, and the improvement of society all depend on our success in helping the people to achieve liberal education. These objectives do not depend on our success in training people to earn a living or in adjusting them to their environment. What the world needs, what the county must have, is free minds. This does not mean minds loaded with archaic infonnation or equipped with obsolescent techniques. It means minds committed to the general good by good moral and intellectual habits. It means minds informed by principles derived from human experience through the ages, minds that will operate well no matter what waves of change beat upon them. If we are to admit everybody to citizenship we must ty to give everybody this kind of education. In so far as men are men they must have this education. Since in our society all men are politically equal, since all men are either rulers or the ruled, they must all be educated to be rulers and the ruled. If we cannot give them all this education, we may as well drop the pretence of democracy. We may as well admit that, though it was a good idea, it would not work.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 2018 |
| <p align="justify">Two principal forms of the constitution are known to history — one is called unitary and the other is federal. The two essential characteristics of a unitary constitution are : (1) the supremacy of the central polity, and (2) the absence of subsidiary sovereign polities. On the contrary, a federal constitution is marked: (1) by the existence of a central polity and subsidiary polities side by side, and (2) by each being sovereign in the field assigned to it. In other words, federation means the establishment of a dual polity. The draft constitution is a federal constitution inasmuch as it establishes what may be a dual polity. This dual polity under the proposed constitution will consist of the Union at the centre and the States at the periphery, each endowed with sovereign powers to be exercised in the field assigned to them respectively by the constitution. This dual polity resembles the American Constitution. The American polity is also a dual polity, one of it is known as the Federal government and the other government of the States which correspond respectively to the Union government and the State governments of the draft constitution. Under the American Constitution the Federal government is not a mere league of the States nor are the States administrative units or agencies of the Federal government. In the same way, the Indian Constitution proposed in the draft constitution is not a league of States nor are the States administrative units or agencies of the Union government. Here, however, the similarities between the Indian and American Constitutions come to an end. The differences that distinguish them are more fundamental and glaring than the similarities between the two. The points of difference between the American federation and the Indian federation are mainly two. In the USA, this dual polity is followed by a dual citizenship. In the USA there is a citizenship of the USA. But there is also a citizenship of the State. No doubt the rigours of this double citizenship are much assuaged by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States which prohibits the States from taking away the rights, privileges and immunities of the citizen of the United States. At the same time, as pointed out by William Anderson, in certain political matters, including the right to vote and to hold public office, the States may and do discriminate in favour of their own eitizens. This favouritism goes even further in many cases. Thus to obtain employment in the service of a State or Loeal government one is in most places required to be a local resident or citizen. Similarly, in the licensing of persons for the practice of such public professions as law and medicine, residence or citizenship in the State is frequently required and in business where regulation must necessarily be striet, as in the sale of liquor, and of stocks and bonds, similar requirements have been upheld. Each State has also certain rights in its own domain that it holds for the special advantage of its own citizens. Thus wild game and fish in a sense belong to the State. It is customary for the States to charge higher hunting and fishing license fees to non-residents than to its own citizens. The States also charge non-residents higher tuition in the State colleges and universities, and permit only residents to be admitted to their hospitals and asylums except in emergencies. In short, there are a number of rights that a State can grant to its own citizens or residents that it may and does legally deny to non-residents, or grant to non-residents only on more difficult terms than those imposed on residents. These advantages, given to the citizen in his own State, constitute the special rights of State citizenship. Taken all together, they amount to a considerable difference in rights between eitizens and non-citizens of the State. The transient and the temporary sojourner is everywhere under some special handicaps. The proposed Indian Constitution is a dual polity with a single citizenship. There is only one citizenship for the whole of India. It is Indian citizenship. There is no State citizenship. Every Indian has the same rights of citizenship, no matter in what State he resides. The dual polity of the proposed Indian Constitution differs from the dual polity of the USA in another respect. In the USA, the Constitutions of the Federal and the State governments are loosely connected. In describing the relationship between the Federal and the State governments, Bryce has said, "The central or national governments may be compared to a large building and a set of smaller buildings standing on the same ground, yet distinct from each other."</p> | 2017 |
